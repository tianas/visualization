    "1. **Life Expectancy plot**: Difficult to understand what's happening here. This should be a two-dimensional plot, and it's not pleasing to look at. It's not an accurate representation because it's hard to see where the bars line up against each other in, e.g., Europe and Oceania. We can understand that some countries are lower than others, but that's pretty much it. Even the colours are misleading: A reader would typically associate red with a more negative outcome. The axes and size of the labels are also difficult to read and look inconsistent (eg. X-axis in title case, Y-axis in all caps) It's not a good data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Monstrous Costs**: Not pleasing to look at. It's difficult to tell what the exact comparisons are between, e.g., 1972 and 1974, since the background doesn't align with these \"bars\". It's *somewhat* clear - especially with the general context of the photo - that the maker is trying to communicate very expensive estimated costs for the 1982 election campaign, but it's still not an easy plot to read at the exact data point level (e.g., what is the value for 1976 against the skewed background?). It's definitely an interesting visualization and has fewer colours than the previous one, but it's still not a good visualization. It also has some odd aspect ratios (as we see on slide 22!).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **2012 Presidential Run**: This one is classic and one I see often when I'm grading undergraduate Statistics assignments on bad visualization. It's not pleasing to look at for many reasons: The blue pie against the same blue background, the % value alignments, the misrepresentation of the data (and in fact, it doesn't even add up to 100%), and it's also not entirely clear who's surveyed (apart from the \"opinions\" source). It doesn't accurately represent the data - we don't know what the total population is. It's not too clear what the message is here. This is a bad visualization for all of these reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Wind Map**: This one looks better than the above ones - there is more information to look at and it's clear that this is about weather information, so the map and visualization make sense. As an interactive image, it makes more sense as you can see the flow. It does represent data accurately, but as a static image, it's difficult to see nuanced differences between, for example, 3 mph and 5 mph areas. There aren't clear enough boundaries between each possible value in the legend. Colour would greatly benefit this plot to better differentiate these more difficult-to-see differences and would make it a much better visualization."
