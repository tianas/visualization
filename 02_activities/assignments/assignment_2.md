# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      Good visualization: https://datavizproject.com/data-type/lollipop-chart/

      This is a lollipop chart that shows Government retirement ages, both current and long-term (where applicable), in a certain selection of countries. The data is very simple here, and I think the plot matches it nicely: Its aesthetic elements (e.g., clean, simple, good proximity between points) makes it pleasing to look at, it portrays the data accurately and honestly and is thus substantive, and the message is simple and straightforward. While lollipop plots aren’t a very common chart type, they still follow a similar style to typical, familiar bar charts, which should reduce cognitive load. There are few unique visual elements in this plot such that it’s easy to understand the comparison of current and long-term values. One detail I appreciate is that the current value is a darker hue of the same colour used for long-term, and the lighter hue is thus easy to compare against the current values while not being the central focus of this plot. The alphabetized y-axis is very helpful for readers to look for a given country’s values within each retirement age. Finally, the figure note is concise and relevant.
      

      Bad visualization: https://datavizproject.com/wp-content/uploads/examples/large.png

           I classified this one as a bad visualization for a few reasons. First, it's not clear, without context, what the variables are. At first glance, this looks like it might be a three-dimensional plot, but I'm not entirely sure because a lot of the data is obstructed behind the "Vila" Brand data. The y-axis is missing units - what is “Data Enrichment” measured in? What is the purpose of this plot? Further, this plot affords a high extraneous cognitive load - it's quite a rare representation for many readers, and as someone who has high familiarity with multi-dimensional plots and visualizations, it was also very hard for me to understand what the point of this plot was and whether it is supposed to be entirely 3D (or perhaps some of the data is missing, which is problematic in itself). Interpretation is approximate, there are too many visual elements involved, and the y-axis isn’t in full, clear view, making the tick marks even harder to match up to the bars. Finally, the colour choice is not ideal - white bars at the back against a white background, for example, aren't aesthetically pleasing.

      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```

      The bad visualization can be improved in a few ways. First, the independent variables need to be clarified. Are we looking at two IVs or one? If it’s about two IVs, we need to be able to see the full data set - it’s generally not good practice to make a plot which is missing a substantial amount of data. I suggest this plot be broken out into a two-dimensional stacked or grouped bar plot. For example, each brand will have a value for each item time, and this should be explicitly stated on the plot, given the variable number of item types (i.e., comparing the size of the plots in a stacked barplot can be tricky). The y-axis should be clear and have units included. All of these more explicit points would reduce cognitive load and allow the reader to gather the gist of the data at first glance.
      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
